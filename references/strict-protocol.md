# Strict protocol — authoring source of truth

This file is **not** read at runtime. No `SKILL.md` links to it, and nothing
in the plugin loads it during a skill invocation — that is deliberate, per
spec §6. A sibling file is only loaded if the model chooses to read it, which
cannot deliver an "always print the checklist" guarantee, and the block's own
first clause ("before any tool call") would be self-violating if obeying it
required a tool call to fetch this file first.

This file exists so that changing the protocol later is a mechanical,
diffable sweep across all 12 skills rather than an archaeology exercise.
Every `SKILL.md` carries a byte-for-byte copy of the block below, pasted in
verbatim by Tasks 7–11. If the protocol ever changes, edit it here first,
then re-sweep all 12 skills from this copy.

The block below — from the `## Strict Execution Protocol` heading through
the end of rule 5 — is `PROTOCOL_BLOCK`: the literal, exact text every skill
carries. Copy it character-for-character. Do not paraphrase, reformat, or
"improve" it during a paste.

## Strict Execution Protocol (non-negotiable)

<!-- juel:protocol v2 -->

**1. Preflight, then task list, before anything else.** Before any other output and before any tool call, emit the Preflight block (below). If the preflight verdict is STOP, print the preflight block and **stop** — do not create tasks and do not begin work. Otherwise, before any other work, create one task per phase in this skill's `## Phases` list via `TaskCreate` — `subject` is the phase name, `activeForm` is its present-continuous form. This task list, rendered persistently by the harness, IS the checklist; nothing else satisfies this rule. This is not optional on re-invocation, on resume, or when the user says "just do it".

**2. Phases run in order.** No skipping, reordering, or merging. A phase that does not apply is still announced, not dropped: mark its task `completed` via `TaskUpdate`, with the one-line evidence required by rule 3 stating the skip reason (e.g. "SKIPPED: <reason>") — the task list has no separate "skipped" status, so a skipped phase becomes `completed` too. Never begin phase N+1 before phase N's task is marked `completed`.

**3. Report after every phase.** Mark the phase's task `in_progress` via `TaskUpdate` when starting it, then `completed` via `TaskUpdate` when it finishes or is skipped — each transition accompanied by exactly one line of evidence (path written, command run, count found). Do not re-print the checklist as text; the task list is the persistent record and replaces that. Never claim progress in prose alone.

**4. Everything runs in the FOREGROUND; `review-pr`'s agents run in PARALLEL.** This overrides every other instruction in this file and in any skill invoked from it. Foreground/background and parallel/sequential are different axes: foreground vs. background is about whether you wait and watch; parallel vs. sequential is about whether agents run concurrently. The requirement is concurrent-and-watched — dispatched together, run in the foreground, waited on in full.
- `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`'s agents MUST be dispatched in parallel: pass `all parallel`, or dispatch the agents together in ONE message. Its sequential default — one agent at a time — is the exact slowness this rule exists to prevent; requesting it, or omitting `all parallel`, is a violation.
- `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`, `simplify`, and `codex exec` are all foreground-only. Invoke every subagent with `run_in_background: false` **explicitly** — the harness backgrounds subagents by default, so omitting the flag is a violation, not a neutral choice. Dispatching agents in parallel does not relax this: each agent in that one message still carries its own explicit `run_in_background: false`.
- Never `&`. Never `run_in_background: true`. Never "dispatch and continue".
- **Never redirect a command's output to a log file.** No `> out.log`, no `| tee`, no writing output somewhere to read back later. The user must be able to watch the run as it happens.
- Read the complete output and state the outcome — finding count, exit status, files changed — before marking the phase done. A summary may follow the raw output; it may never replace it.
- Passing any of this into another session (a CMUX prompt, a nested `claude`) carries these rules with it — say so explicitly in that prompt string.

**5. Confirmation gates stack; they do not replace this.** Where this skill pauses between phases, the checklist report comes first, then the "Proceed to phase N+1?" question. A user's "yes" advances exactly one phase — it never authorizes skipping ahead or batching the remainder.
